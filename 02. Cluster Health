Elastic terminalogy explained 

1. 
An Elasticsearch cluster is made up of one or more nodes. Each of these nodes contains indexes which are split into 
multiple shards. Elasticsearch makes copies of these shards called replicas. 
These (primary) shards and replicas are then placed on various nodes throughout the cluster.


2.
Elasticsearch provides a handy "traffic lights" classification of cluster health. Here is a simple explanation of each of 
the options.

RED: Damnit. Some or all of (primary) shards are not ready.

YELLOW: Elasticsearch has allocated all of the primary shards, but some/all of the replicas have not been allocated.

GREEN: Great. Your cluster is fully operational. Elasticsearch is able to allocate all shards and replicas to machines 
within the cluster.

3.

cluster health is yellow, meaning shard replicas have not been allocated. Why is this? This is because the current 
cluster only consists of a single node, so the replicas remain unasigned simply because no other node is available to 
contain them.. This can fix by adding another node to the cluster.

4.
When the cluster is yellow, everything is OK however your replica rules are not satisfied: Requests can still be 
handled successfully, but if ever your server completly fails (and corrupts), you risk losing some of your documents 
if you havn't got a replica of the data elsewhere in the cluster. The status will update to green once your cluster 
contains enough nodes to allocate the replicas..
